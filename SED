# SED - Stream Editor

## Description:
One of the first editors on unix.

Different versions behave differently.  Many do not work as advertised

Allowed editing on files larger than available memory (ram).
  Most (all) editors loaded contents in memory.
  Memory was expensive per MEG... $$$ GIG's $$$.
  Editors and tools developed to deal with files larger than available memory.
    - cat, split, join, grep, tr, tee, comm, uniq, awk, perl, col, fmt, etc.
    - troff, nroff
    - regular expressions

SED will process text files with unlimited size.
Does not load the file in memory.
Reads sequentially through file and writes output as it processes through the file.
Uses record addressing scheme based on lines,
   (<cr> - carrage returns, <lf> - line feeds)

** Most used operation: s/<old>/<new>/ **
     substitute first occurence on a line containing <old> with <new> through entire file.


## Usage:
sed '<address><command><modifier>' <filename>
  address = start,finish
  command = s/<old>/<new>/   d/thing/
  modifier = 1st occurence    g - all occurences on a line
